Demonstration of unintentional leakage of private data in federated learning environment. This repository was part of my term project submission, Data Analytics course (CLL 788), IIT Delhi.

The project was directly inspired from following research papers which have tried to point out privacy issues in federated learning environment. It could be noted that this directly contradict with their supposed advantage over centralized learning environment
